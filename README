It's a simple contact form application for multi-lang sites.
This is my first django-cms plugin.

Feel free to use.

Put "cmsplugin_contact.contact" in your INSTALLED_APPS settings.py section.
Don't forget to syncdb your database.

Notes by jamting:

Added CSRF-protection + minor changes.

If you're using south do this to setup database after adding plugin to INSTALLED_APPS:

- python manage.py schemamigration --initial cmsplugin_contact.contact
- python manage.py migrate
